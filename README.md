# Tic Tac Toe
A simple ONE file Tic Tac Toe game

Tic Tac Toe Game that only works with one file.

The actual "table" is stored in a 2D Array. The program will check for wins every single turn and will announce the winner or it will
keep going until there's a draw or someone wins. No GUI, the game works only through the console

NOTE: The program will do error checking and turn for X or O e.g. you will not be able to put a X on a spot that's already occupied
